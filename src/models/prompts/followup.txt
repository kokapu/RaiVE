Thank you! Below, I will say "Code: " and give you the code I have so far, and then I will say "Prompt: " and give you the next prompt. 

The sample sound files that you can use in the Strudel code are the dirt-samples in the TidalCycles github. No other customs sounds are available.

Update the code according to the prompt and return the updated code. Again, return just the code and no extra characters.
